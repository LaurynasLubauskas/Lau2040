## 12/15/2025 - First journal, and the start of the project! (5 hours spent)

This is the first journal and the start of my second big project. My first big project was my own small keyboard called [MinBoard](https://github.com/LaurynasLubauskas/MinBoard.git). And now I am making my own Rp2040. I think this is a great project to get me stated with microcontrollers. So now about what I have done. I have created the schematics of the microcontroller using the [tutorial](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/starter-projects/devboard) that was made by Kai Pereira. It took me a while, because there are lots of wires to connect, but I am very proud with my progress. After creating the Lau2040 I am planning to connect it to a screen so it could display whatever I want. This is it for my first journal and I hope I am finished with the microcontroller in the next journal.
